Major

TPM
- -

fixed 64-bit conversion for Windows with Visual Studio

Utilities:
- - - - -

getpubek can get owner password from a file
quote and quote2 can accept externalData, output quote data, version,
       and signature,
quote and quote2 can verify against certificate or public key blob
added IMA extend, verify, and parse functions


Minor

Utilities:
- - - - -

Renamed identity utility to makeideentity
Added better tracing of openssl errors
NV Index zeroed before delete
fixed license header on some utilities, were IBM confidential, should be BSD


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes from 4665 to 4720

Major
____

TPM
- - -

Don't use physical presence flag if CMD enable is false

Utilities:
- - - - -

mv_writevalue
	added write from file
	added write with certificate prefix
nv_readvalue
	added read to file
	added read to strip certificate prefix
separated activateidentity and makeidentity
added option to activateidentity to read and decrypt AIK certificate with symmetric key
added quote option to validate against certificate
create revokable EK used wrong encryption algorithm
takeown, counter, delegation, migration accept ownerAuth from file
added tpm_proxy for Windows 7

Minor
-----

TPM:
- - -

Fixed debug print plus some style errors reported by Coverity

Utilities:
- - - - -

Skip exponent tests for HW TPM
When setting CMD physical presence, permit error setting CMD enable because 
	lifetime lock may be set


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes from 4078 to 4665

Major
____

TPM
- - -

Added support for NSS/FreeBL and gnump crypto libraries to support use
case where the OpenSSL licence is an issue.
	Refactored crypto code, hoisted common functions.
	Abstracted BIGNUM library and objects.
	Added second low level crypto source to call NSS and gnump.
	Added several makefile examples.

Added volatile state serialization functions to support VTPM migration
      Added SHA-1 context load and store.
      Added test option with store and reload after each command.

Utilities:
- - - - -

NV define space and take ownership utilities now support PCR
specification.

Can create keys with non-default size and exponent


Minor
-----

TPM:
- - -

Fixed several cases where AUTHFAIL and AUTH2FAIL were reversed.

Added checks for valid key size, legal public exponent, EK type

Added TPM_ProcessA(), easier to call directly than TPM_Process()

Constants have #ifndef so they can be specified in the makefile

Fixed TPM_DSAP error where session may remain after an error.

Separated TPM_ALLOC_MAX from TPM_BUFFER_MAX.

Optimized NV storage when no PCRs are selected.

Fixed some and added many trace statements

Updated getcapability property to specification 116

Fixed compiler error and removed errant tracing when TPM_DEBUG is not
defined.

Utilities:
- - - - -

More command line utilities have consistent arguments.  Fixed
some usage print errors.

Fixed bug in utilities MGF1 for 64-bit platform

Create EK sets the (optional) EK type to support HW TPMs that do not
ignore it.

Added TPM proxy error checking and reporting

Recoded to remove gcc type punning and uninitialized variable false
warnings.
